              These Terms are an agreement between Collective Nexus, LLC and you and govern your use of the Site and all information on or submitted through it.

Some of the Content on the Site is not available for downloading, such as our copyrighted works that we do not distribute or works of others that we are not permitted to distribute. However, we also may have Content that if so designated may be downloaded by you pursuant to these Terms (“Available Content”). YOU MAY REVIEW, DOWNLOAD, COPY, DISTRIBUTE AND USE THE AVAILABLE CONTENT SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF YOUR PERSONAL USE. YOU MAY NOT SELL THE AVAILABLE CONTENT OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE IT FOR A FEE.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This Site is controlled by us from our offices within the United States of America.

              Linked Sites. Our Links to Other Sites: Our Site may contain links to Web sites of third parties. We provide these links as a convenience, but do not endorse the linked site or anything on it. While their information, products, services and information may be helpful to you, they are independent entities and we do not control or endorse them. You agree that any visits to linked sites are at your own risk and governed by their privacy policies (if any).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Your Links to Our Site: You are not permitted to link or shortcut to our Site from your Web site, blog or similar application, without obtaining prior written permission from us.

              <br/>
              <br/>
              Amendments. You agree that from time to time we may alter (including adding or eliminating all or parts of provisions) these Terms, including but not limited to the Privacy Policy (“Amendments”). Amended versions of these Terms will take effect on the date specified for the amended version (“Effective Date”) and will apply to all information that was collected before or after the Effective Date, including information in databases. You have no continuing right to use the Site – it is like a store and each time you visit you will be subject to the version of the Terms in effect on your visit. Like terms on the door to a store, those terms will change from time to time and the changes will be effective when they appear in a replacement version of these Terms as posted by us on the Site. No other Amendments will be valid unless they are in a paper writing signed by us and by you.
              Each time you return to the Site, you are responsible for checking the effective date of then posted version of these Terms – if it later than the date of the version last reviewed, the Terms have           been changed and the new version should be reviewed before using the Site. USE OF THE SITE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE WILL CONSTITUTE YOUR CONSENT TO THE                                   AMENDMENTS, SO IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE BOUND BY AN AMENDED VERSION, DO NOT USE THE SITE AND CEASE ALL USE OF THE CONTENT OR SERVICES.


              <br/>
              <br/>
              GOVERNING LAW AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. These terms and your use of the Site are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, except where you are required by published governmental law, ordinance, regulation, directive, order, or the like (collectively, “Mandate”) to contract for application of the law of your local jurisdiction. Your hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction of a state or federal court of general jurisdiction sitting in King County, Washington, U.S.A. except to the extent you are prohibited from doing so by a Mandate.

              <br/>
              <br/>
              Legal and Other Notices or Disclosures. Notice to You: You agree that we may give all notices we are required to give you by posting notice on the Site or, if we have your email address, by sending notice by email at our discretion, including (without limitation), disclosures that we are required to give you, legal notices, notice of subpoenas or other legal process (if any), and all other communications. When we communicate by email, we may use any email address you provide when communication with us or that we otherwise have in our records, so only supply to us an email address at which you are willing to receive all communications, including “legal” or potentially sensitive communications. You agree to check for notices posted on the Site.

              <br/>
              <br/>
              Entire Agreement; Miscellaneous. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy (including any of the supplemental privacy policies), Amendments and any: (a) notices, terms and items incorporated into any of them; (b) additional terms and conditions contained on the Site for particular activities or Content; and (c) our disclosures and your consents provided on or in connection with the Site or any Content, service or other activity; constitute the entire agreement between you and Collective Nexus, LLC regarding the Complete Site or the subject matter of the foregoing (collectively, “Entire Agreement”). If any provision of the Entire Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, its remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, provided that the allocation of risks described herein is given effect to the fullest extent possible. The foregoing does not impair the enforceability of additional agreements you enter into.
              Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Time is of the essence of the Entire Agreement and there are no third party beneficiaries of it. The terms of this Section 15, Sections 3 and 4, 6 through 10, and 13 through 15, and our rights under the Privacy Policy will survive termination or cancellation of this Agreement. You may print or make an electronic copy of the Entire Agreement for your official records; to the extent required by law, we hereby instruct you to do so. You            may not assign these Terms or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.
