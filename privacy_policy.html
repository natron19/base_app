            <br/>
            <br/>
            Effective Date: Mar 22, 2016
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Welcome. This Policy is designed to help you understand generally how collectivenexus.com collects personally identifying information about you and how Collective Nexus, LLC uses and discloses that personal information. This Policy applies to information that personally identifies you (other than publicly available information) (“personal information”) collected on collectivenexus.com or, where indicated, other information you provide to us.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            USE OF OUR SITE OR PROVISION OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION CONSTITUTES AGREEMENT TO THIS POLICY. DO NOT USE THE SITE OR PROVIDE INFORMATION (OR ALLOW OTHERS TO DO SO ON YOUR BEHALF) IF YOU (AND YOUR PRINCIPAL IF YOU ARE ACTING AS AGENT) DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS OF USE INCLUDING THIS POLICY AND ANY APPLICABLE SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY POLICY.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How Does This Policy Relate to Use of the Site?<br/>
            This Policy is part of and incorporated into the collectivenexus.com Terms of Use, which is the contract between you and Collective Nexus, LLC. Parts of the Terms of Use affect this Policy, so, unless you have already done so, please review them prior to using the Site. Terms used but not defined in this Policy have the definitions in the Terms of Use.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Information We Collect That You Do Not Provide<br/>
            Sometimes we collect personal information without you having to enter any information on the Site. For example, we may receive personal information from public sources or from third parties (which we may combine with other information from other sources).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In addition, we collect some information automatically from visitors to the Site, for example through the use of “cookies”, “web beacons”, and other tracking mechanisms. We collect at least the following: your domain name and host for Internet access; the Internet address of the site from which you came; the date and time of your access; your computer’s IP address and information about its operating system, browser and host; the date and time you access the Site and the pages you visit. If you do not want to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject them. However, if you turn cookies off, you may not have access to some of the Site’s services and features. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you access the Site. We also may employ Web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the operations of our site. We prohibit Web beacons on our site from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Information We Collect That You Do Provide<br/>
            It is always your choice, or the choice of anyone acting for you, whether to provide personal information. However, some must be provided to participate in certain programs or activities (such as to apply for a job), so the decision not to provide information might limit or eliminate certain functions of the Site or the ability to participate. Other information is up to your good judgment, e.g., do not provide personal information about yourself that could be misused by others in a chat room, bulletin board, blog or similar forum and do not provide personal information about others without their permission. The kinds of personal information we tend to request about you or others include but are not limited to your name, email address, native language, organization name, job title, city, state / province, region, age, locations for internet access and devices used. Additional information about what we collect is available in any supplemental privacy policies for particular activities.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Information You Provide About Others<br/>
            Do not supply personal information about others unless you are authorized or required to do so by applicable law or contract and you consent to the Terms of Use on behalf of yourself and the “data subject” (the person about whom you supply personal information). Before supplying personal information about others (except as otherwise allowed by law or contract), you must make available for the data subject’s review, and obtain their written consent to, said Terms of Use and policies. By submitting any personal information about others, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and that you did all of the foregoing before submitting the information. If applicable law allows you to supply the information without doing the foregoing, you represent and warrant that you have abided by that law and that it allows us to receive and disclose the information under this Policy without any further action on our part. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless against any failure by you to comply with this paragraph.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What We Generally Do with Personal Information Collected<br/>
            In general, we use personal information we collect to pursue our mission and operations and to engage in the activity (and related activities) for which we collect it. Specifically, we may use your personal information to:
